  "Desc": "The calendars are already a hit! I knew this device was a good idea!\nYou might have noticed the symbol in the top-left of the scratch paper. That's the cursor. All of your brush strokes are placed according to the cursor position. I still don't have the tool to move the cursor yet, but we could just rotate the whole paper instead.\nHere, try out this pattern. It's a logo I came up with for our new venture. Don't worry about the orientation in the end - we can just turn it or flip it however we need after the machine is finished.",
